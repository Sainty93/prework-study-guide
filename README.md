# prework-study-guide
Guide for class
# Description

## A page to study our recent bootcamp class

This study guide was meant to assist boot camp students with prework.

- My motivation was to push myself outside my comfortzone and try something new. Belive in myself.
- I built this project to better understand the curriculum of class, to get a beter understanding. 
- It solved the problem of me basically not knowing anything about coding, this guide helped me learn the basics before class.
- I learned the basics of coding vocabular, i learned about JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. 



## Usage

You can open prework modules, or dev tools to look for instructions on how to use guide and what to study first. You would need to add a reo, issues, branches. Work on html, js, and css individually to finalize our project.
